**Description of the Project:**
1. a. Solve LunarLanderContinous using discretization of action space

   b. Solve LunarLanderContinous using discretization of action space and without using the velocities information.
2. Solve BipedalWalkerHardcore with 3000 episodes

In order to run the notebook, we have 2 sections, PART 1 and PART 2.

Run *Lunar DDQN with Velocity*:

* Run all cells until the text label of PART 1.
* Run all cells from PART 1 label to *DDQN with velocities*, not included.
* Run all cells from *DDQN with velocities* label to *DDQN without velocities.*

Run *Lunar DDQN without Velocity*:

* Run all cells until the text label of PART 1.
* Run all cells from PART 1 label to *DDQN with velocities*, not included.
* Run all cells from *DDQN without velocities* label to *DQN with velocities.*


Run *Lunar DQN with Velocity*:
